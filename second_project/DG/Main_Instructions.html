<h2> Welcome to ESSEXLab </h2>

</ul>

<h2> Guidelines </h2>
<ul>
    <li> You will be paid in private and in cash at the end of the experiment. </li>
    <li> The amount of money that you ultimately earn in the experiment depends on your decisions, the decisions of others and random chance. </li>

<h2> How final earnings are computed </h2>
<ul>
   <li> You will receive £5 for showing up on time (as the show-up fee). </li>

   <li> You will be paid privately and in cash at the end of the experiment. </li>
</ul>
