<h2> Structure of the block </h2>
<ul>
  <li> In this block there are <b>2</b> main tasks. </li>
      <ul>
          <li> Guessing the First Mover's choice, and </li>
          <li> Guessing the Second Mover's choice. </li>
      </ul>
  <li> You will participate in 12 guessing problems. </li>
  <li> Each problem is equally likely to be selected for payment. </li>
  <li> Thus, it is important for you to take each problem seriously. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Structure of the task 1 </h2>
<ul>
    <li>There are 4 guessing problems in task 1. You need to: </li>
        <ul>

    <li> You are asked to make eight conditional guesses with four different payment structures.  </li>

<h2> How your additional payment in this block is calculated: </h2>
<ul>
    <li> You will be able to earn up to £5 in addition to your earnings in other blocks.</li>
    <li> You will receive the additional payment if you are able to outperform the random machine in guessing the choice of others.</li>
    <li> After you submit all guessing problems, your earnings will be calculated by the following procedure:</li>
    <ul>
        <li> One out of 12 guessing questions will be chosen at random;</li>
        <li> One participant (anonymous) in this room (excluding you) will be picked at random and her/his decision will be retrieved;</li>
        <li> Your guessing error is computed as (1-your choice)&sup2 if the choice picked by the selected participant is A and (your choice)&sup2 if the decision picked by the selected participant is B;</li>
        <li> A uniform random number will be drawn form the interval from 0 to 1;</li>
        <li> You will receive £5 (in addition to money you already earned) if your prediction error is below the random number and will not receive any additional payment otherwise;</li>
        <li> For example:
            <ul>
                <li>The guessing question 4 is randomly chosen, and you have selected 1%-20%. If, </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The First Mover chose A in the corresponding payment structure, and the random number that is generated by computer is 0.7</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> So your guessing error is (1-your choice)&sup2: (80% to 99%)&sup2= 0.64 to 0.9801, because 0.7 > 0.64. So you get £5</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>The First Mover chose A in the corresponding payment structure, and the random number that is generated by computer is 0.5</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> So your guessing error is (1-your choice)&sup2: (80% to 99%)&sup2= 0.64 to 0.9801, because 0.5 < 0.64. So you get £0</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>The First Mover chose B in the corresponding payment structure, and the random number that is generated by computer is 0.3</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> So your guessing error is (your choice)&sup2: (1% to 20%)&sup2= 0.0001 to 0.04, because 0.3 > 0.0001. So you get £5</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>The First Mover chose B in the corresponding payment structure, and the random number that is generated by computer is 0</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> So your guessing error is (your choice)&sup2: (1% to 20%)&sup2= 0.0001 to 0.04, because 0 < 0.0001. So you get £0</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li> You will only see outcomes in the end of the experiment. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> <d>Keep in mind</d>, if your guess is more close to others' real choice, the higher probability that you will earn £5.</li>
    <li> Read this page carefully, we will test your comprehension in the next page.</li>
