    <p>
        During this block, you will be asked to make decisions in 4 different situations. You will be randomly paired with another anonymous participant. Your decisions in one decision situation have no influence on other situations.
    </p>

    <p>
        In each decision situation, you and your paired participant need to make decisions SEQUENTIALLY. That is, one of you and your paired participant is the First Mover who needs to make decision first, and the another is the Second Mover who will make decision after observing the First Mover's choice. Thus, the Points of you and your paired participant will be jointly determined by both of your decisions!
    </p>

    <p>
        Before asking you to make decisions, we first allocate your role (whether you are the First Mover or the Second Mover).
    </p>

    <p>
        At the end of the experiment, we will RANDOMLY choose one decision situation’s final Points (determined by your and your randomly paired participant’s choices) as your additional participant fee.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once a decision situation ends, you can move to another new decision situation.
    </p>

    <p>
        ONE EXAMPLE: The roles, choices and the Points in the following decision situation:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="4"> First Mover (You)</td>
            <td colspan="3"> Second Mover (Other) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td style="..."> Left </td>
            <td style="..."> Right </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Top</td>
            <td>{{ C.payoff_1R1 }} , {{ C.payoff_1R2 }}</td>
            <td>{{ C.payoff_1S1 }} , {{ C.payoff_1T2 }}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Down</td>
            <td>{{ C.payoff_1T1 }} , {{ C.payoff_1S2 }}</td>
            <td>{{ C.payoff_1D1 }} , {{ C.payoff_1D2 }}</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        In this example, you are the First Mover, and the Other randomly paired participant is the Second Mover.
    </p>

    <p>
        The left hand side (with purple color) in each cell represents your payoff, while the left hand side (with green color) represents the payoff of another participant you are randomly paired with (Other in the table).
    </p>

    <p>
        This table shows the payoff associated with each choice. In this decision situation, you and Other will jointly decide the payoffs of both of you.
    </p>

    <p>
        That is, if:
    </p>

    <p>
        You, as the First Mover, chose ''Top''. After observing your choice, another paired participant, as the Second Mover selected ''Left''. So you earn 40 Points while the Other earns 40 Points.
    </p>

    <p>
        You, as the First Mover, chose ''Top''. After observing your choice, another paired participant, as the Second Mover selected ''Right''. So you earn 20 Points while the Other earns 50 Points.
    </p>

    <p>
        You, as the First Mover, chose ''Down''. After observing your choice, another paired participant, as the Second Mover selected ''Left''. So you earn 60 Points while the Other earns 20 Points.
    </p>

    <p>
        You, as the First Mover, chose ''Down''. After observing your choice, another paired participant, as the Second Mover selected ''Right''. So you earn 25 Points while the Other earns 25 Points.
    </p>

    <p>
        ANOTHER EXAMPLE: The roles, choices and the Points in the following decision situation:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="4"> First Mover (Other)</td>
            <td colspan="3"> Second Mover (You) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td style="..."> Left </td>
            <td style="..."> Right </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Top</td>
            <td>{{ C.payoff_1R1 }} , {{ C.payoff_1R2 }}</td>
            <td>{{ C.payoff_1S1 }} , {{ C.payoff_1T2 }}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Down</td>
            <td>{{ C.payoff_1T1 }} , {{ C.payoff_1S2 }}</td>
            <td>{{ C.payoff_1D1 }} , {{ C.payoff_1D2 }}</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        In this example, Other is the First Mover, and you are the Second Mover.
    </p>

    <p>
        The left hand side (with purple color) in each cell represents Other’s payoff, while the left hand side (with green color) represents your payoff.
    </p>

    <p>
        That is, if:
    </p>

    <p>
        Other, as the First Mover, chose ''Top''. After observing his/her choice, you, as the Second Mover selected ''Left''. So Other earns 40 Points while you earn 40 Points.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other, as the First Mover, chose ''Top''. After observing his/her choice, you, as the Second Mover selected ''Right''. So Other earns 20 Points while you earn 50 Points.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other, as the First Mover, chose ''Down''. After observing his/her choice, you, as the Second Mover selected ''Left''. So Other earns 60 Points while you earn 20 Points.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other, as the First Mover, chose ''Down''. After observing his/her choice, you, as the Second Mover selected ''Right''. So Other earns 25 Points while you earn 25 Points.
