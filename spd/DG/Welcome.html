    <p>
        Thank you for participating in our experiment. You are about to participate in a session on decision-making.
        During the experiment, no one would know your identity (anonymously). You will be paid privately at the end of the session by cash.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the session, Please SILENCE or TURN OFF your cellular phones and do not make noise during the experiment.
        The entire session will take place through computers in front of you. Please do not talk or in any way try to discuss with other participants during the experiment.
        If you have any questions during the session, please raise your hand and we will come and help you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our experiment contains THREE blocks. In each block, we will start with a brief instruction where you will be given a description of the main features of the block.
        After the instruction, you can move to the next page where you will be asked to answer several questions to test your understanding the task of this block.
        Only when you answer all questions correctly, you are allowed to move to the formal session.
    </p>

    <p>
        N.B. At the end of the experiment, we will randomly select one of your decision situations.
        Depending on the decisions by you and your randomly paired participant, you could earn a considerable amount of money.
        Your earnings from this decision situation will be converted from Points to Pounds at a rate of 10 Points = £1.00！
    </p>

    <p>
        You are able to make up to 10.00 additional pounds depending on your decisions.
        This will be added to your participation fee of £5.00.
        During the session, you should stay on each page for at least a specific time, otherwise, you can not see the ``Next'' button and move to the next page.
